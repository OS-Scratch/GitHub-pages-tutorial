Great news! We're happy to announce that myOS 3.0 will be fully compatible with the InterApp kernel by bambus80 for cross-platform support! Opening up new possibilities, the kernel will make it easier for you to manage myOS, including volume controls and a very popular feature introduced in myOS SO 1.3: Wallpaper changing! myOS 3.0.6.5 includes the kernel, but we'll ship the cool possibillities with 3.0.7. Stay tuned!
